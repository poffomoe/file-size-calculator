# File size calculator program!

## Purpose

Thought I'd write something that would be useful for me.

I think it does better job at displaying actual size of a directory than Dolphin and `du`?.. Not sure though.

## Features

You can calculate the **size of a file or directory** *(or file)* with it! **Revolutionary!!!** 

## How to use

`file-size-calculator /path/to/directory/or/file`

If no path was specified, the program will calculate the size of current directory.

## Issues

1. **~~IT WILL CRASH IF THERE IS TOO MANY LEVELS OF SYMLINKS AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO FIX IT :D~~** i fixed it pogchamp
2. `du` is faster :'(
