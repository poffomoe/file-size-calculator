# File size calculator program!

## Purpose

Thought I'd write something that would be useful for me.

I think it does better job at displaying actual size of a directory than Dolphin and `du`?.. Not sure though.

## Features

You can calculate the **size of a file or directory** with it! **Revolutionary!!!** 

## How to use

I don't know why you would need a tutorial.
1. Put your path in `Path::new("{your_path}")`.
2. `cargo run` or `rustc ./src/main.rs`, assuming you're in project root.
